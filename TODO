Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we really need this?).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
	Make ga work in background.
	Think about good key for creating links (like pl in ranger, al, rl).
    Make :ch +x work like :!chmod +x %f. Create Change dialog and add :chmod,
        :chown commands.
    Better C command. Handle selection and situation when destination already
        exists.
    Implement :find command.
    An option to choose shell ('shell').
    Make l key handle selection.
    %something for absolute filenames.
    Skip all directories in history that don't exist.
    More states for permissions dialog (maybe 'f', 'd').
    Backgrounding of vicmd (& at the end).
    Perform operations using system calls, not programs.  This is much faster
        and will ease porting on Windows (less dependencies on Cygwin).
	:restore command to restore files from Trash
    Modify X in permissions dialog.
    Be more verbose about regexp compiling errors.
    Show search matches in the menus.
    Check whether user is the owner on :change.

Documentation.
	Better documentation.
    Document :ls command (for screen program).
    Document using P to move files on fs different from where /home is.
    Document command line keys.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
	Add set values completion for :set command (there are no such options yet).
	Add :s/pattern/replace/ command.
    Add 'vifminfo' option.  This removes 'savelocation' option and moves FILTER.
    Add something ('freezmarks' option ?) to prevent user loose his bookmarks 
        accidentally. (maybe we don't need this now, because of :mark command
        and the startup file)
    Add one more color to color scheme for error messages in status bar.
    Add one more color to color scheme for broken links.
    Some kind of selection mode (multible blocks, mixing).
    gs to work with t selection just like gv with visual mode selection.
    Add :mksession command and 'sessionoptions' option.
    Add 'vifminfo' option.
    Save active pane (with positions) on exit (session and vifminfo).
    Make directory history persistent (session and vifminfo).
    Make command line history persistent (session and vifminfo).
    Make search history persistent (session and vifminfo).
    Make dirstack persistent (session and vifminfo).
    Save registers (session and vifminfo).
    :highlight command.
    Better registers support.
    :$ in the menus (check other commands like this one).
    v /, v ?, d /, d ?
    :map without arguments

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
    Add a command to copy current pane location into X11 clipboard.
	Add mouse support.
	View of directories.
    Swap names of two files (selected or given as arguments).
    Invert selection?
    :g = grep :g! = grep -v
    :history without duplicates.
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    A :restart function to reload everything.
    Maybe something like :g/.../ and :v/.../ in Vim.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Reverse searching  (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)
    Improve sorting ('sort' and 'gsort'; ignore case).
    Reset options to it's default value (from docs) with set option&.
    :locate without arguments repeats last search.
    :cd [dir1] [dir2]; :cd! dir equivalent to :cd dir dir; or :gcd
    cl key to modify links.
    filetypes for X and for console
    What about yD to copy selected file(s) into other directory, and YD to move

Vim plugin
    Choose between one and two pane view on startup somehow.

Other (questionable) things.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Add ... at the end of a title or always add it in the middle
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we should add a command to view screen ?
    Completion for co and cg commands ?
    Directory create command ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    With undo groups we can not only join commands, but maybe implement
        something like transaction rollback.  Or maybe better to leave this
        for user, he could always press u himself.
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :sellocal command.
    :split directory
    Highlight for view window (see ranger).
    Remove items from :history cmd?
    Option with format of statwin.
    Filetype support for directories.
    :edit, etc. in menus.
    :alias
    Like gv but to select just pasted files (gp?).
    Ctrl-W in command line mode like in vim?
    Move file name to the title of other pane in view mode.

Code improvements.
    Write more tests.
    Add function like status_bar_message() but with format and varargs.
    Think about escape_filename and it's len argument.
    Rename exec_* to something.
    Add log.
    Stay at the same file in some cases.
