Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings.
	Backgrounding of commands with job control.
	Fix window resizing.
	Better documentation.
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
    :! command completion.

Vi specific features that need to be added.
	Finish implementing range and count for user commands.
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links. 
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just 
		the dot filter and regular expression filter.
    Make some kind of undo command.
    :set command for options.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap? 
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.  
    Store panel directories with qw, w, qwa, wa (ZZ in normal mode)
        end restore them on start up (possible problems with pwd and
        argument, how to choose between them? arg > stored > pwd?).
