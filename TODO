Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we really need this?).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Better documentation.
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell
        (fixed??).
	Make ga work in background.
	Make ranges modify %f macro.
	Think about good key for creating links (like pl in ranger).
	Fix :'<'>!echo %f
    Rename files in Trash.
    Make :filter do the same as :filter!
    Make :ch +x work like :!chmod +x %f. Create Change dialog and add :chmod,
        :chown commands.
    Better C command. Handle situation when destination already exists.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Finish implementing range and count for user commands (what commands left?).
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
	Add set values completion for :set command (there are no such options yet).
	Add 'smartcase' option.
	Add :s/pattern/replace/ command.
    Add 'vifminfo' option.  This removes 'savelocation' option and moves FILTER.
    Add something ('freezmarks' option ?) to prevent user loose his bookmarks 
        accidentally.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
    Add a command to copy current pane location into X11 clipboard.
	Add mouse support.
	View of directories.
    Swap names of two files (selected or given as arguments).
    Add :mark command.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).

Other (questinable) things.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Don't wrap command history (what about an option for this?).
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Save active pane on exit (session).
    Save active files on exit (session).
    Make command line history persistent (session).
    Make directory history persistent (session).
    Add ... at the end of a title or always add it in the middle
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we shouldn't clear screen on exit and add a command to view screen ?
    Rename pauseme to vifm-pauseme to avoid possible conflicts ?
    Completion for co and cg commands ?
    Directory create command ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    With undo groups we can not only join commands, but maybe implement
        something like transaction rollback.  Or maybe better to leave this
        for user, he could always press u himself.
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :sellocal command.

Code improvements.
    Move completion code from cmdline to a separate file.
    Write more tests.
