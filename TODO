Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we really need this?).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Better documentation.
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell (fixed??).
	Make ga work in background.

Vi specific features that need to be added.
	Finish implementing range and count for user commands (what commands left?).
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
	Make some kind of undo command.
	Add more options for :set command.
	Add set values completion for :set command.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
    Add a command to copy current pane location into X11 clipboard.
