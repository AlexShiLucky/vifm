Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we need this? curses does).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
	Make ga work in background.
    Make :ch +x work like :!chmod +x %f. Create Change dialog and add :chmod,
        :chown commands.
    Perform operations using system calls, not programs.  This is much faster
        and will ease porting on Windows.
	:restore command to restore files from Trash
    Better cW command (maybe accept count of extensions to skip).
    Better globals support.
    Maybe remove 'trash' option, since we have two commands for deletion.
    Directory create command, mkdir
    Maybe remove 'sortorder' and change 'sort' to '+name,-uid,...'

Documentation.
	Better documentation (with normal tags in Vim version).
    Maybe divide vifm.txt in several files (if it becomes too big).

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
    Add one more color to color scheme for error messages in status bar.
    Some kind of selection mode (multible blocks, mixing).
    :highlight command.
    Better registers support.
    /, ?, n, N as selectors.
    Make / and ? accept count.
    :map without arguments
    Should 'history' control search and cmdline history or there should be
        other options?
    Better ranges.
    Ctrl-A and Ctrl-X commands.
    'scrolloff' option.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
	Add mouse support.
    Invert selection? (what :command or key?)
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    Maybe something like :g/.../com and :v/.../com in Vim.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Reverse searching (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)
    Improve sorting (ignore case (iname, maybe iext); ignore dirs).
    Add :mksession command and 'sessionoptions' option.
    'incsearch' option.
    'wrapscan' option.
    'scrollbind' option.

Other (questionable) things.
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we should add a command to view screen ?
    Completion for co and cg commands ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide how to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :sellocal command.
    Remove items from :history cmd?
    Option with format of statwin.
    :edit, etc. in the menus.
    :alias
    Like gv but to select just pasted files (gp?).
    'expandtab' for tabs in the quick view ?
    Modify marks on rename operations.
    Remove ncursesw dependency (remove unicode functions, we use utf-8).
    :toupper and :tolower

Code improvements.
    Write more tests.
    Improve logging (print back trace).
    Stay at the same file in some cases.
