Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we need this? curses does).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
    Show background commands presence in the TUI.
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
    Perform operations using system calls, not programs.  This is much faster.
    Show operation progress.
    Better globals support.
    Maybe remove 'trash' option, since we have two commands for deletion.
    Templates for :touch.
	Mouse support.
    Ctrl-R combinations in the command-line mode.
    Add the UNC computer name (after the \\) (%h, :H or :u).
    Wrapping of lines in the menus.
    Execute command arguments on :restart.

Documentation.
	Better documentation.
    Maybe divide vifm.txt in several files (if it becomes too big).

Windows.
    Permission dialog could change file attributes.
    Add a command to create .lnk files.
    Follow targets of .lnk files.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
    Some kind of selection mode (multiple blocks, mixing).
    Better registers support.
    /, ?, n, N as selectors.
    Make / and ? accept count.
    :map without arguments
    Better ranges.
    Ctrl-W F key.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
    Invert selection? (what :command or key?)
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    Maybe something like :g/.../com and :v/.../com in Vim.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Reverse searching (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)
    Improve sorting (maybe iext; maybe ignore dirs).
    Add :mksession command and 'sessionoptions' option.
    Position macros for user defined commands (%1, %2, ..., %9).
    Some key to (un)select all files with extension of current file.

Other (questionable) things.
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we should add a command to view screen ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide how to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :setlocal command.
    Remove items from :history cmd?
    Option with format of statwin.
    :edit, etc. in the menus.
    :alias
    Like gv but to select just pasted files (gp?).
    'expandtab' for tabs in the quick view and menu items?
    Modify marks on rename operations.
    :toupper and :tolower
    Maybe accept regular expressions as second argument of :colo command.

Code improvements.
    Write more tests.
    Improve logging (print back trace).
    Stay at the same file in some cases.
