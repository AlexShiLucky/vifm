Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we really need this?).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Better documentation.
    Remove vifm-help and generate it each time man page changed.
    Document trimming of trailing spaces for maps.
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell
        (fixed??).
	Make ga work in background.
	Make ranges modify %f macro.
	Think about good key for creating links (like pl in ranger).
	Fix :'<'>!echo %f
    Rename files in Trash.
    Make :ch +x work like :!chmod +x %f. Create Change dialog and add :chmod,
        :chown commands.
    Better C command. Handle situation when destination already exists.
    Make child processes continue working after vifm shutdown.
    Ctrl-C on error message before vifm start should skip all error messages
        until startup process will be finished.
    Add :filetype command.
    Make option parser understand quotes yet.
    Make ~user_name/ work.
    Remove s command from the documentation.
    Implement :find command.
    What :ls command should do?
    Run commands from :cmdhistory menu.
    Default filter string should be empty.
    An option to choose shell.
    Don't replace escape sequences for :! and :!! commands.
    Make l work in visual mode.
    Filetype support for directories.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Finish implementing range and count for user commands (what commands left?).
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
	Add set values completion for :set command (there are no such options yet).
	Add 'smartcase' option.
	Add :s/pattern/replace/ command.
    Add 'vifminfo' option.  This removes 'savelocation' option and moves FILTER.
    Add something ('freezmarks' option ?) to prevent user loose his bookmarks 
        accidentally.
    :map shouldn't affect command line mode, :map! should.
    Add one more color to color scheme for error messages in status bar.
    Add aliases for options (like 'go' for 'guioptions' in Vim).
    Add 'confirm' option.
    Add support of count for command line commands.
    Add :unmap commands.
    Add :noremap commands.
    Skip command aliases on command completion.
    Some kind of selection mode.
    Generalize gv to work with t selection.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
    Add a command to copy current pane location into X11 clipboard.
	Add mouse support.
	View of directories.
    Swap names of two files (selected or given as arguments).
    Add :mark command.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Invert selection?
    :g = grep :g! = grep -v
    :filter! pattern same as :filter pattern | invert, and :filter! = :invert
    :history! and :cmdhistory! same as normal versions but without duplicates.
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    A :restart function to reload everything.
    Maybe something like :g/.../ and :v/.../ in Vim.
    Reverse searching  (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)

Vim plugin
    Choose between one and two pane view on startup somehow.
    Handle l when more then one file selected.
    Look at the Ranousse patch for tabs.

Other (questionable) things.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Don't wrap command history (what about an option for this?).
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Save active pane on exit (session).
    Save active files on exit (session).
    Make command line history persistent (session).
    Make directory history persistent (session).
    Make search history persistent (session).
    Make dirstack persistent ? (session).
    Add ... at the end of a title or always add it in the middle
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we shouldn't clear screen on exit and add a command to view screen ?
    Rename pauseme to vifm-pauseme to avoid possible conflicts ?
    Completion for co and cg commands ?
    Directory create command ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    With undo groups we can not only join commands, but maybe implement
        something like transaction rollback.  Or maybe better to leave this
        for user, he could always press u himself.
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :sellocal command.
    :split directory, :only directory
    Highlight for view window (see ranger).
    Remove items from :cmdhistory
    Option with format of statwin.

Code improvements.
    Move completion code from cmdline to a separate file.
    Write more tests.
    Store escaped version of cfg.trash_dir somewhere and use it in commands.
