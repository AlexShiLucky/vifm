Basic things that need to be done.
	Termcap or terminfo support for keybindings (do we really need this?).
	Backgrounding of commands with job control (pause/resume/kill).
	Fix window resizing (I think it's almost done).
	Handle commands that are too long to be passed directly to the shell.
	Make ga work in background.
    Make :ch +x work like :!chmod +x %f. Create Change dialog and add :chmod,
        :chown commands.
    More states for permissions dialog (maybe 'f', 'd').
    Modify X in permissions dialog.
    Perform operations using system calls, not programs.  This is much faster
        and will ease porting on Windows (less dependencies on Cygwin).
	:restore command to restore files from Trash
    Better cW command (maybe accept count of extensions to skip).
    Don't quit when terminal is too small (print message and ignore input).

Documentation.
	Better documentation.
    Document command line keys.
    Document which commands understand macros.

Vi(m) specific features that need to be added.
	Fix '' to go back to all jumps G gg links (in one directory?).
	Change file list filters to use fold levels instead of just
		the dot filter and regular expression filter (what does this mean?).
    Add one more color to color scheme for error messages in status bar.
    Some kind of selection mode (multible blocks, mixing).
    :highlight command.
    Better registers support.
    d /, d ?
    :map without arguments
    Should 'history' control search and cmdline history or there should be
        other options?
    Let user map <c-?> keys.

Possible things to add.
	Use system wide mimetypes file. /etc/mailcap?
	Virtual File System - currently vifm can use fuse to mount most
		file systems.
	Add mouse support.
    Swap names of two files (selected or given as arguments).
    Invert selection? (what :command or key?)
    :g/arg = grep arg; :v/arg = grep -v arg
    Make :undolist more interactive.
    Maybe something like :g/.../com and :v/.../com in Vim.
    Add g/ and g? commands (search, but don't select files).
    Reverse searching (/ for search, g/ for selecting, g!/ for selecting
        reverse)
    Improve sorting ('sort' and 'gsort'; ignore case).
    Add :mksession command and 'sessionoptions' option.
    Maybe ignore ranges in the command line history.
    y/source/dest like in sed (or like tr program).
    Modify marks on rename operations.

Other (questionable) things.
    Use mimetypes in FILETYPE.
    %i macro to prompt user for input.
    Maybe inotify support on Linux.
    Command like ' but that executes bookmark ?
    Maybe we should add a command to view screen ?
    Completion for co and cg commands ?
    Directory create command ?
    Summarize size of selected files.  Need to decide how to display it.
    Add support for comments at the end of line ? Just for fun?
    Make directory stack menu interactive ?
    Maybe add + and - commands to undo by commands, not command groups.
    :sellocal command.
    Remove items from :history cmd?
    Option with format of statwin.
    :edit, etc. in the menus.
    :alias
    Like gv but to select just pasted files (gp?).
    'expandtab' for tabs in the quick view ?

Code improvements.
    Write more tests.
    Rename exec_* to something.
    Improve logging (print back trace).
    Stay at the same file in some cases.
