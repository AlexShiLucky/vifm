Selection isn't cleared on keys in normal mode.

%s macro depends on undocumented external dependency (script called
screen-open-region-with-program).

When output of something like `:filter?` fills whole screen two character
positions filled with border color are left (in left and right top corners).
It also displays only beginning of a message, there is no way to scroll it.

gid/uid are displayed as -1 on some file systems.

:apropos command doesn't escape its arguments, thus characters like | are
passed directory to a shell.

:filetype checks doesn't expand ~ and environment variables.

Fix wildmenu case sensitivity on Windows (or maybe it's OK as it is).

Screen split title cannot be overwritten when it's run from `:shell`.

:change->Name renames only one file even when several are selected.

On OpenBSD there might be issues with non-ascii characters.

"*" at the beginning of a glob doesn't match empty string (e.g. "*doc" should
match "doc", but it won't).  This is a limitation of turning list of globs into
single regular expression.
