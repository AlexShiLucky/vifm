NAME
       vifm [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
       Vifm  is  a ncurses based file manager with vi like keybindings. If you
       use vi, vifm gives you complete keyboard control over your files  with‐
       out having to learn a new set of commands.

OPTIONS
       The  vifm executable will start vifm in the current directory unless it
       is given a different directory on the command line.

       <lwinpath>
              Starts Vifm in the specified path.

       <lwinpath> <rwinpath>
              Starts Vifm in the specified paths.

       Paths to files are also allowed in case you want  vifm  to  start  with
       some archive opened.

       -f     only  used  from  the  vifm.vim  script.  The selected files are
              written to ~/.vifm/vimfiles and vifm exits.

       --logging
              Log some errors to ~/.vifm/log.

       --help, -h
              Show an overview of the commandline options.

       --version, -v
              Show version information and quit.

       Ctrl-c or Escape
              clear all selected files.

       Ctrl-l clear and redraw the screen.

Basic Movement
       The basic vi key bindings are used to move through the files and  popup
       windows.

       k      moves up.

       j      moves down.

       h      moves up one directory.

       l or Enter
              moves into a directory or launches a file.

       gg     move to the top of the file list.

       G      move to the bottom of the file list.

       H      move to the first file in the window.

       M      move to the file in the middle of the window.

       L      move to the last file in the window.

       Ctrl-W X
              exchange panes.

Marks
       Marks are set the same way as they are in vi.
              You can use this characters for marks [a-z][A-Z][0-9].

       m[a-z][A-Z][0-9]
              to set a mark for the current file.

Searching
       /regular expression pattern[Return]
              will highlight all files matching the pattern and go to the next
              match.

       ?regular expression pattern[Return]
              will highlight all files matching the pattern and go to the pre‐
              vious match.

       n      find the next match of / or ?.

       N      find the previous match of / or ?.

       f[character]
              search  forward  for file with [character] as first character in
              name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       F[character]
              search backward for file with [character] as first character  in
              name.  Search wraps around the end of the list.

       ;      find the next match of f or F.

       ,      find the previous match of f or F.

File Filters
       The basic vim folding key bindings are used for filtering files.

       All directorys will show the ../ file no matter what the filter setting
       is with the exception of the / directory.

       Each file list has its own filter.

       Filtered files are not checked in / search or :commands.

       zo     Show all of the dot files.

       zf     Filter all of the selected files.

       za     Toggle the showing and hiding of dot files.

       [count]yy if compatibility mode is on
              yanks the selected files.

       Y      same as yy.

       p      will  copy the yanked files to the current directory or move the
              files to the current directory if they were deleted with  dd  or
              :d[elete] or if the files were yanked from the Trash directory.

       P      moves the last yanked files.

              delete  (count  + 1) files starting from current cursor position
              upward.

Selectors
       y and d commands accept selectors.  You can combine them with every of
              selectors below to quickly remove or yank several files.
              Most of selectors are like vi motions: j, k, gg, G, H, L, M,  %,
              f, F, ;, comma and '.  But there are some additional ones.

       a      all files in current view.

       s      selected files.

       S      all files except selected.

Visual Mode
       In visual mode work almost all normal mode keys, but they do not accept
       selectors.

       O      switch active selection bound.

Commands
       Commands are executed with :command_name<Return>

       ´|' can be used to separate commands, so you can give multiple commands
       in one line.  If you want to use '|' in an argument,  precede  it  with
       '\'.

       Commented  out  lines  should start with the double quote symbol, which
       may be preceded by whitespace characters.

       :[count]

       :number
              move to the file number.
              :12 would move to the 12th file in the list.

              The  only  builtin  :[count]command  are  :[count]d[elete]   and
              :[count]y[ank].

       :d3    would  delete  three files starting at the current file position
              moving down.

       :3d    would delete one file at the third line in the list.

       :command [args]

       :!program
              will execute the program in a shell

       :!command &

       will run the process in the background using vifm's means.

       Programs that write to stdout like ls  will  create  an  error  message
       showing partial output of the command.

       Take note of the space before ampersand symbol, if you omit it, command
       will be run in the background using job control of your shell.

       :!! <program>
              is the same as :! but will pause the screen before returning  to
              Vifm.

       :!!    will execute the last command.

       :apropos manpage
              will  create  a  menu  of items returned by the apropos command.

       :cd ~/dir
              change directory to ~/dir.

       :change
              create a menu window to alter a files properties.

       :colo[rscheme]
              gives  a  menu  with a list of available color schemes.  You can
              choose default color scheme here.  It will be used for  view  if
              no  DIRECTORY  in colorscheme file fits current path.  It's also
              used to set border color (except view titles) and colors in  the
              menus and dialogs.

       :colo[rscheme] color_scheme_name
              changes   default   color   scheme  to  color_scheme_name.   See

              Unlike  vim  user  commands  do not have to start with a capital
              letter.  User commands are run in a shell by default.  To run  a
              command  in  the background you must set it as a background com‐
              mand with & at the end of the commands action (:com rm rm %f &).

       :com[mand] backup /pattern
              will set search pattern.

              rently  only  * and ? are treated as special symbols in the pat‐
              tern.  If you need to insert comma into command just  double  it
              (",,").

       :filex[type] pat1,pat2,... def_program,program2,...
              same as :filetype, but vifm will ignore this command if it's not

              screen program uses pseudo terminals to allow  multiple  windows
              to  be  used in the console or in a single xterm.  Starting vifm
              from screen with the screen option turned on will cause vifm  to
              open  a  new  screen  window for each new file edited or program
              launched from vifm.
              This requires screen version 3.9.9 or newer for  the  screen  -X

Ranges
       The ranges implemented include:
         Numbers :2,3
         % - the entire directory.
         . - the current position in the filelist.
         $ - the end of the filelist.
         't - the mark position t.

         :%delete would delete all files in the directory.
         :2,4delete would delete the files in the list positions 2 through 4.
         :.,$delete  would  delete  the files from the current position to the
       end
           of the filelist.
         :3delete4 would delete the files in the list positions 3, 4, 5, 6.

       If a backward range is given :4,2delete - an query message is given and
       user can chose what to do next.

       The builtin commands that accept a range are :d[elete] and :y[ank].

Command macros
       The command macros may be used in user commands.

       %a     User arguments.

       %c     The current file under the cursor.

       %C     The current file under the cursor in the other directory.

       %f     All of the selected files.

       %F     All of the selected files in the other directory list.

       %b     Same as %f %F.

       %d     Full path to current directory.

       %D     Full path to other file list directory.

       %m     Show command output in a menu.

       %s     Execute command in screen split.

       Use %% if you need to put a percent sign in your command.

       Position and quantity (if there is any) of %m and %s macros in the com‐
       mand is unimportant.  All their occurrences will be  removed  from  the
       resulting command.

       %c  and  %f  macros are expanded to file names only, when %C and %F are
       expanded to full paths.  %f and %F follow this in %b too.

       :com move mv %f %D
              would set the :move command to move all of the files selected in
              the current directory to the other directory.

       The  %a macro will substitute any arguments given in a command into the
       command.  All arguments are considered optional.  ":com lsl !!ls -l %a"
       will set the lsl command to execute ls -l with or without an argument.

       :lsl<Return>
              will list the directory contents of the current directory.

       :lsl filename<Return>
              will list only the given filename.

       The  macros  can  also be used in directly executing commands. ":!mv %f
       %D" would move the current directory selected files to the other direc‐
       tory.

       Appending & to the end of a command will cause it to be executed in the
       background.
              :!mv %f %D &

              default: true
              Controls whether to wrap text in quick view.

Mappings
       Since it's not easy to enter special characters there are several  spe‐
       cial sequences that can be used in place of them. They are:

       <cr>   Enter key

       <space>
              Space key

       <f0> - <f63>
              Functional keys

       vifm  removes  whitespace  characters  at the beginning and end of com‐
       mands.  That's why you may want to use <space> at the  end  of  rhs  in
       mappings.  For example:

        cmap <f1> man<space>

       will  put  "man " in line when you hit the <f1> key in the command line
       mode.

Compatibility mode
       Compatibility mode:
           - <tab> to switch between panes.
           - dd deletes selected (or current if none) files.
           - yy yanks selected (or current if none) files.

       Vim like mode:
           - <c-i> (<tab>) to go forward on history.
           - dd deletes file under the cursor and ds works as dd  in  compati‐
       bility mode.
           -  yy yanks file under the cursor and ys works as dd in compatibil‐
       ity mode.

Menus and dialogs
       General

       j, k - move.  <Escape>, Ctrl-c - clear.  <Return>, l - select and  exit
       the menu.

       In all menus

       Ctrl-b/Ctrl-f  Ctrl-d/Ctrl-u  Ctrl-e/Ctrl-y / and ?, n/N [num]G/[num]gg
       H/M/L zb/zt/zz

       All these keys have the same meaning as in normal mode (but  not  L  in
       filetype menu).

       : - enter command line mode for menus (currently only :exi[t], :q[uit],
       :x[it] and :range are supported).

       Commands menu

       dd on a command to remove.

       Bookmarks menu

       Escape or Ctrl-c to abort j and k to move through.  dd on a bookmark to
       remove.

       Filetype menu

       Commands  from vifmrc are displayed above empty line. When all commands
       below empty line were found in .desktop files.  Note:  you  can't  save
       programs for files without extension.

       J  and K - to move menu items L - save all commands above empty line as
       program list

       Sort dialog

       h - switch ascending/descending.  Space - switch ascending/descending.

       Permissions dialog

       h - check/uncheck.  Space - check/uncheck.

Configure
       The ~/.vifm/vifmrc file contains commands that will be executed on vifm
       startup.   Use it to set settings, mappings or filetypes.  To use multi
       line commands precede each next line with a  slash  (whitespace  before
       slash  is  ignored,  but all spaces at the end of the lines are saved).
       For example: set
           \smartcase equals "setsmartcase".  When set<space here>
            smartcase<space here> equals "set  smartcase ".

       The ~/.vifm/vifminfo file contains session settings.  You may  edit  it
       by  hand  to  change the settings, but it's not recommended to do that,
       edit vifmrc instead.  You can control what settings will  be  saved  in
       vifminfo by setting ´vifminfo' option.  Vifm always writes this file on
       exit unless 'vifminfo' option is empty.  Bookmarks, commands, directory
       history  and  filetypes  in the file are merged with vifm configuration
       (which has bigger priority).

       The ~/.vifm/scripts directory can contain shell scripts.  vifm modifies
       it's  PATH  environment  variable to let user run those scripts without
       specifying full path.

Plugin
       Plugin for using vifm in vim as a file selector.

       Commands:

         :EditVifm   select a file or files to open in the current buffer.
         :SplitVifm  split buffer and select a file or files to open.
         :VsplitVifm vertically split buffer and select a  file  or  files  to
       open.
         :DiffVifm    select  a  file  or files to compare to the current file
       with
                     :vert diffsplit.
         :TabVifm    select a file or files to open in tabs.

       The plugin does not have any settings.

       To use the plugin copy the vifm.vim file  to  either  the  system  wide
       vim/plugin directory or into ~/.vim/plugin.

       If  you would prefer not to use the plugin and it is in the system wide
       plugin directory add

       let loaded_vifm=1

       to your ~/.vimrc file.

Reserved
       The following command names are reserved and shouldn't be used for user
       commands.
